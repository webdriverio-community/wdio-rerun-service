This service tracks failing Mocha or Jasmine tests and Cucumber scenarios executed within the [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io) test framework. It will allow failing or unstable tests or scenarios to be re-run.

_NOTE_: Users running WebdriverIO `7.x.x`, use version `1.7.x` version of this service. If you are on the latest major version of `8.x.x`, use the latest `2.x.x` version of this service.

## Re-run vs. Retry

The `retry` logic built into WebdriverIO for Cucumber and Mocha/Jasmine is helpful for handling flaky steps in Cucumber and Mocha/Jasmine. Retrying in each framework has caveats: 
* Cucumber: It does not take into account that some steps may not be able to be retried in the middle of a test. Running a step twice may break the rest of the Scenario or it may not be possible in the test context. 
* Mocha/Jasmine: The `retry` logic may be applied to an individual test, however, this is still done in real-time and perhaps does not account for temporal issues or network connectivity problems.

The main distinctions of the `re-run`:
* Will re-run an entire individual Cucumber Scenario and not just a single step
* Enables an entire spec file to be re-run after a main test execution is complete
* May be copied and executed locally (`retry` cannot)
* Can still be used in conjunction with `retry` methods
* Does not require any code change to apply `retry` logic to flaky or problematic tests

It is recommended to take some time to evaluate the options available. A hybrid solution may be the best solution to provide the best real and actionable test results.

## Installation

Using `npm`:

```bash
npm install wdio-rerun-service
```

or using `yarn`:

```bash
yarn add wdio-rerun-service
```

After package installation is complete, add it to `services` array in `wdio.conf.js`:

```js
// wdio.conf.js
import RerunService from 'wdio-rerun-service';
export const config = {
    // ...
    services: [RerunService, {
        // ...
    }]
};
```

Instructions on how to install `WebdriverIO` can be found [here.](https://webdriver.io/docs/gettingstarted.html)

## Configuration

The following options may be added to the wdio.conf.js file. To define options for the service you need to add the service to the `services` list in the following way:

```js
// wdio.conf.js
import RerunService from 'wdio-rerun-service';
export const config = {
    // ...
    services: [
        [RerunService, {
            // Re-run service options here...
        }]
    ],
    // ...
};
```

### rerunDataDir
Directory where all the re-run JSON data will be kept during execution.

Type: `String`

Default: `./results/rerun`

Example:
```js
import RerunService from 'wdio-rerun-service';
export const config = {
    // ...
    services: [
        [RerunService, {
            rerunDataDir: './custom-rerun-directory'
        }]
    ],
    // ...
}
```

### rerunScriptPath
Path to write re-run Bash script.

Type: `String`

Default: `./rerun.sh`

Example:
```js
import RerunService from 'wdio-rerun-service';
export const config = {
    // ...
    services: [
        [RerunService, {
            rerunScriptPath: './custom-path-for-rerun.sh'
        }]
    ],
    // ...
}
```

### ignoredTags
(Cucumber-only) Set of Cucumber tags to exclude. If scenario contains a tag, the re-run service will skip analysis.

Type: `Array`

Default: `[]`

Example:
```js
import RerunService from 'wdio-rerun-service';
export const config = {
    // ...
    services: [
        [RerunService, {
            ignoredTags: ['@known_bug']
        }]
    ],
    // ...
}
```

### commandPrefix
Prefix which will be added to the re-run command that is generated.

Type: `String`

Default: `''`

Example:
```js
import RerunService from 'wdio-rerun-service';
export const config = {
    // ...
    services: [
        [RerunService, {
            commandPrefix: "VARIABLE=true"
        }]
    ],
    // ...
}
```

### customParameters
Parameters which will be added to the re-run command that is generated.
Can be used with `commandPrefix`.

Type: `String`

Default: `''`

Example:
```js
import RerunService from 'wdio-rerun-service';
export const config = {
    // ...
    services: [
        [RerunService, {
            customParameters: "--foobar"
        }]
    ],
    // ...
}
```
